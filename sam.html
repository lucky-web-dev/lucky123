    <h2 id="arcshot">Arc shot</h2>
    <p>An arc shot is a camera move around the subject, somewhat like a tracking shot.

In mathematics, an arc is a segment of the circumference of a circle. A camera arc is similar — the camera moves in a rough semi-circle around the subject.

Some definitions of the arc shot describe it as being tracking and dollying at the same time, i.e. simultaneous side-to-side and in-and-out movement.

    <p>ver the last 11 years, Marvel Studios has built a franchise unlike anything the movie world has ever seen before. More than just launching an incredible run of multiple series that each center on unique characters and establish their own specific aesthetics, they’ve also maintained an immensely complex continuity that expands with each new story. Every filmmaker who contributes to the universe adds a new piece to the puzzle, carving out something different and diverse that is also crafted to add to the bigger picture.

Within this approach there are gradients, and it results in two basic kinds of Marvel Studios films. On one side you have titles like Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians Of The Galaxy, which find their own corner of the expansive world and use that specific real estate for relatively contained storytelling. On the other side there are titles like The Avengers and Captain America: Civil War, which are designed with the entire scope of the franchise in mind, and utilize specific details and elements of the larger continuity to create something both reflective and new.

As tremendous and exceptional as the movies in the former category can be (and that’s pretty extreme), it’s those in the latter that make the Marvel Cinematic Universe truly special. Simply making a cogent and entertaining blockbuster is a ridiculous challenge all by itself, so you’d think that simultaneously incorporating the massive details of multiple other massive films would be practically impossible. And yet, the studio has been successful time and time again.

This brings us to Joe and Anthony Russo’s Avengers: Endgame – a film that has been specifically described over the last four-and-a-half years as the movie that would be the ultimate capstone for the franchise, and exist as the story to which all of the previous 21 chapters have been leading. Obviously that’s an incredible amount of hype, and the end result is that it’s now considered one of the most anticipated releases in history… but what’s even more utterly spectacular is the fact that every ounce of that hype is totally justified.

Simply put, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most ambitious, entertaining, emotional, and stunning blockbusters we’ve ever seen, and the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe canon thus far.

Based on a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who previously wrote four of the best films in this franchise), the movie picks up following the shattering events of last year’s Avengers: Infinity War, and finds the surviving heroes (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Renner, Paul Rudd, Karen Gillan, Bradley Cooper, and Brie Larson) figuring out how to move on after Thanos (Josh Brolin) successfully managed to collect all six Infinity Stones and wipe out half of all life in existence. The depression and devastation is real following their defeat, but the titular team, living up to their name, is not ready to give up. Using both their brawn and their brains, they concoct a plan that they hope will not only lead to defeating the Mad Titan, but also right the horrific wrong that has been inflicted on the universe.

If it’s not obvious, the vagueness of that plot description is entirely intentional, as the surprises that unfold in Avengers: Endgame’s perfectly-paced three hour runtime can only be properly appreciated when personally witnessed – and there’s a new one that comes around just about every five minutes as you’re watching. Whether it’s actors you never expected in a million years to show up; locations you never thought you’d see; or plot twists that come from the parking lot behind left field, it’s a movie that not only keeps you constantly guessing about what could possibly come next, but succeeds in dropping your jaw with every swing that it takes, both with the novel and the familiar.

In reflection, it feels like every choice was the choice that the film needed to make in order to be successful. But at the same time it's mind-bending to recognize both how well the movie pulls them off, and that the franchise as a whole has gotten to a place where they could actually be done.

Arriving part and parcel with all of these surprises is the extremely entertaining experience that is watching the film. Thus far, the greatness of the Russo brothers’ contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been found in the dramatic weight and heft that they’ve brought to these stories – at a steadily increasing level from Captain America: The Winter Soldier to Captain America: Civil War to Avengers: Infinity War – and while all of that is still there, Avengers: Endgame also has a remarkably different tone. It’s most definitely still an emotional ride, and in moments is actually heartbreaking, but the nature of its story also allows it to be fun in a way that’s only been experienced in small tastes in their previous features. It will be a challenge for pretty much anyone to watch this one without a goofy grin plastered on their face for the bulk of the runtime (especially during the climactic third act, which is an epic masterpiece unlike anything else).</p>
<h2 id="pro">Prometheus<h2>
    <p>1977 Ridley Scott was one of the directors of TV commercials whom David Puttnam plucked from the small screen to make their feature debuts in the cinema. Based on a novella by Joseph Conrad, Scott's first film was The Duellists, a costume drama about the obsessive rivalry between two cavalry officers in the Napoleonic wars. It was elegantly staged and respectfully received. It was, however, his second film, Alien, two years later that made him a director of world stature. This seminal science-fiction movie was in effect a transposition to outer space of a Conrad novel about a run-down tramp steamer picking up a lethally dangerous passenger from a remote island. Out there among the stars, where no one can hear you scream, as the advertising tagline put it, it becomes a horrific tale of a dilapidated inter-stellar cargo vessel, the Nostromo, answering an SOS and taking on board an androgynous monster of total malevolence. The Duellists was a virtually all-male affair. But third officer Ripley, one of only two female crew members on the Nostromo, was played by the formidable Sigourney Weaver, first in the succession of strong women in Scott's movies.

Scott played no part in the decreasingly impressive Alien franchise that continued over the next 30 years. But he did make another seminal SF movie, Blade Runner, and has apparently long been toying with the idea of a sort of prequel to Alien. This we now have in the form of Prometheus, an ingenious, well-worked-out exploration of the source and nature of the creature that caused havoc on the Nostromo, with a script by two young Americans, Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. There are many direct and indirect references to Alien in the new film (as well as to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey), which is more cerebral and mystical than Scott's 1979 picture.

Prometheus begins, as Kubrick's did, with a trail of clues on Earth that takes the explorers into space. In 2089 two archaeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (the lively Swedish star Noomi Rapace) and Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover ancient pictograms in a cave on Skye that persuade them that visitors from a distant planet have visited earth. She's a practising Christian sporting a cross around her neck, he's a militant atheist, and they gradually become convinced that these extraterrestrials might have actually created our world.

The film then jumps ahead in time and space. The spaceship Prometheus, a scientific exploratory vehicle, is approaching a forlorn, unknown planet on 21 December 2093, on an expedition financed by the elderly head of the giant Weyland Corporation. Shaw and Holloway are among the 17 people aboard, and the crew and scientific staff are just waking up from two years of sleep on the cryogenic deck. The only person awake throughout the voyage is the suave, handsome android David (Michael Fassbender), who unlike the robot played by Ian Holm in Alien declares his identity immediately. David is an engaging invention, a cross between Jeeves and a double agent in a Jacobean melodrama, and his favourite movie is Lawrence of Arabia, the story of a control freak moving between two cultures.

Immediately on touchdown in this godforsaken place, everyone goes eagerly about their business and not unpredictably they discover signs of present or past habitation, some of it reminiscent of the mysterious subterranean world the Nostromo crew visited. Especially excited are Shaw and Holloway, eager to test their theses, but there are also secret agendas being followed by devious capitalists. Most notable among the latter is Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the chilly Weyland official heading the operation. She stands in sharp contrast to the warm, open Elizabeth Shaw, and her name more than hints at a kinship to the arms industry and an association with institutionalised violence. Fortunately the sturdy ship's captain (Idris Elba), like the sensible skipper taking the reckless Carl Denham to Skull Island in King Kong, is only concerned for everyone's safety and welfare.

Scott steadily allows the tension to build, always aware that expectations aroused by a return to the original Alien must be satisfied but not repeated, and that the questions raised by the original picture have to be confronted. Yes, there has to be something equivalent to the monstrous parasite leaping out of John Hurt's chest, but it must not be the same, and it is devastatingly brought about as Scott and his writers observe Chekhov's admonition that if you hang a pistol on the wall in the first act, it must be fired in the third. In this case for pistol read robotic medical pod for conducting complicated surgery in space. Of the conflicts, imbroglios, confusions and appalling revelations that ensue I will only say that nothing quite like this ever befell anyone on an Apollo mission.

Prometheus is a strongly acted, superbly designed movie, an exciting and at times emetic experience. Some surprises might have been anticipated with a little thought, others not. It's a weightier undertaking than Alien, an existential horror picture that didn't attempt to raise the big religious, cosmological and teleological issues that are thrashed out here. Some may find it pretentious, and the title, suggestive of hubristic man confronting the gods, has the film flaunting its ambition. But the action moves so swiftly that for most of the time I wasn't aware, as I usually am, of it being in 3D, and the final couple of minutes are as gut-wrenching as anything in the Alien cycle.</p>
